Problem statement
----
Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, 
return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

**For example**  
- Given the list `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k = 17`,  
return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.  

- Given the list `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k = 8`,  
return `false` since there is no pair with sum `8`
